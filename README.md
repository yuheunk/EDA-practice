# EDA-practice

## 1. DS4C_Data Science for COVID-19 in South Korea
This was done for a course assignment. The following data was used for this EDA.
- [kaggle data](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset)
- [data description](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/ds4c-what-is-this-dataset-detailed-description)


Additional library that I used is `folium`. Check out my folium map from [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) if you're interested.
> Installation: `pip install folium`<br>
For more information please refer to the [documentation](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/index.html)<br>
I used [korean geo-data source](https://github.com/southkorea/southkorea-maps/tree/master/kostat/2018/json) to make a choropleth map of COVID-19 in South Korea.
